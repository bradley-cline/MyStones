_by Bradley Cline - 2018_

## Usage
**UtiliJewel** currently have 3 functions: 
- To price new jewelry items based off their precious metal and diamond values, 
- To provide quick access to common conversions for the jewelry and watch repair industry
- To provide a digital, quick access rolodex of vendor information for locating watch parts and components

### Pricing Calculator

- No fields are required, but if the user is inputting a weight for the gold, they *must* select a corresponding gold karat (10, 14, or 18kt). 
- All common diamond cuts (shapes) are available in the drop down menu when adding stones to the calculation: round, princess, marquise, pear, trillion, baguette, and oval.
- Each row in the stones box allows the user to select a different stone either based on size, shape, and/or quantity. For example, if a ring has a large center stone and 7 identical smaller stones surrounding it, the user would use two rows. One row for the large center stone and the second row for the 7 identical smaller stones.
- Similarly, a user can select to only price an item based on the diamonds and not factor in the gold value.

### Conversions
There are 4 useful conversions in the conversions tab of the application.

- **Weights** converts between different units of weight measurement: pennyweght(DWT), troy ounces, and grams
- **Ring Blanks** infoms the user how long a piece of gold bar stock will need to be to make a ring of a given finger size
- **Gauge to MM** is a chart showing the conversion from gauge (a measure of thickness) to millimeters
- **Stem Tap Size** is a chart showing the conversion from tap (a measure of watch stem diameter) to millimeters

Currently disabled. Acts as a digital rolodex, allowing the user to search by watch brand to find parts. Lists contact information and account numbers for vendors, as well as information that is useful to have when dealing with the vendors (which agent to talk to, what parts are and are not available, etc.)
